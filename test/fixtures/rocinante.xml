<description>We did it, everybody. The entire team reunites to celebrate a solid end (for now) to a great series. We check in on family dinners, missing (or not missing) pilots, when it&#8217;s time to turn down a job, and our hopes for the video future of the franchise. Chip makes one last Babylon 5 comparison (spoilers for a quarter-decade-old series). And, oh, yeah, we make plans to read some books. &lt;p&gt;Chip Sudderth, Warren Frey, Kayti Burt and Jen Burt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And Kayti Burt asks the REALLY pressing question: &#8220;Who cares about the Arboghast, anyway?&#8221; </description>

We meet Prax, get annoyed by Diogo again, see Naomi and James use the &#8220;L&#8221; word while at least ONE of them promises &#8220;no more secrets,&#8221; and we get a crash course in Belter politics delivered by the formidible Anderson Dawes.

<description>Midway through Season 2, The Expanse finally makes it through all of the events featured in Book #1, Leviathan Wakes. We can&#8217;t imagine not having had Chrisjen around this whole time, so: good job, show! Not so sure about that Epstein vignette, though. Or the scene that ties up Miller and Julie&#8217;s storylines. What can we say? Our podcast contains multitudes. </description>
